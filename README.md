## ‚ú® Features & Technical Implementation

This project successfully implements a modern DevOps and DevSecOps workflow with the following key features:

### 1. Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline

*   **Fully Automated Workflow:** The pipeline, configured in `.github/workflows/main.yml`, automates all stages from code commit to live deployment.
*   **GitFlow Branching Strategy:**
    *   Commits to the `develop` branch automatically trigger a deployment to the **Staging** environment.
    *   Merges to the `main` branch trigger a deployment to the **Production** environment.
*   **Manual Production Gate:** A manual approval step is required before any code is released to production, ensuring an extra layer of safety and control.

### 2. DevSecOps Integration

*   **Automated Testing:** Unit tests are executed automatically within the pipeline using Jest and Supertest to validate application functionality before any deployment.
*   **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrated **Snyk** to automatically scan Node.js dependencies for known security vulnerabilities on every run, preventing insecure code from being deployed.
*   **Secret Management:** All sensitive credentials (Docker Hub tokens, SSH keys, etc.) are securely stored and accessed using GitHub's encrypted secrets.

### 3. Release Management

*   **Conventional Commits:** All commits follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for a clean and readable version history.
*   **Changelog:** A detailed `CHANGELOG.md` is maintained to document all notable changes and releases.
